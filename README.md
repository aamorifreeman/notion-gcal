# Notion â†’ Google Calendar Task Sync

A Google Apps Script project that bridges **Notion** and **Google Calendar**.  
It turns tasks from a Notion database into Google Calendar events and automatically creates a **Daily Task Review** summary event.

## Features

- **Sync Notion tasks â†’ Calendar events**  
  - Creates an all-day event for each task with a due date.  
  - Includes details in the event description (Type, Class, Resources).  
  - Marks tasks as `Synced` in Notion to prevent duplicates.

- **Daily Task Review summary**  
  - Creates (or updates) a **Daily Task Review** all-day event each morning.  
  - Summarizes unfinished tasks that are:  
    - ðŸ”´ Overdue  
    - ðŸŸ¡ Due Today  
    - ðŸŸ  Due Tomorrow  
    - ðŸŸ¢ Due in the Next 7 Days  
  - Provides a quick glance at whatâ€™s due without opening Notion.

- **Preserves task history**  
  - Each dayâ€™s review event is unique, so you can look back at past daily summaries.
